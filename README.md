## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox

### What I learned

Learnt how hard web dev truly is even for a seemingly small project like this. Also learned a few new concepts that I still have to grasp fully. Went through a lot of challenges completing this project as well.

I'm really proud of this bit of css code. On a normal day, I wouldn't understand any of this.

```css
button {
  font-family: "Montserrat", sans-serif;
  color: white;
  background-color: hsl(158, 36%, 37%);
  border: none;
  border-radius: 5px;
  width: 220px;
  vertical-align: top;
  font-weight: bold;
  height: 40px;
  cursor: pointer;
}
```

### Continued development

Still need to work on my flexbox skills although I do believe I am becoming better. Writing HTML isn't a problem for me but CSS is (as is the case for most if not all web devs). I aim to improve my skills in CSS and hopefully I can start getting into frameworks and such.

### Useful resources
